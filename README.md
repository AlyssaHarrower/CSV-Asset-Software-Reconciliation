# CSV-Data-Reconciliation
Python project that takes two .csv files and reads them. It then creates a .csv file that highlights inconsistencies.

For a real use case I coded this specifically to take a list of assets and their software and compare it against a software list.
If certain software is missing from the asset, it will add that asset into the new .csv file with the missing software listed next to it.
